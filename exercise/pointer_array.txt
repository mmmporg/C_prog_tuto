Create an array 3x5 with the following values:

23 45 67 89  0
45 67 89  6 19
11 77 13 17 10

By using pointer, write two functions, one to permit the user to make zeros on one entire rows and exit from the program, another to permit the user to do the samething but with columns, if the user enter an invalid input or row or column that does'nt exists, print an error message. The result looks like:

that is a table:

23 45 67 89  1
45 67 89  6 19
11 77 13 17 10

please enter "r" to work with rows and "c" to work with columns: r
please select the row concerning: 2

23 45 67 89  1
0   0  0  0  0
11 77 13 17 10

goodbye!
